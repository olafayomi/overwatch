# Overwatch
## Description

A platform for centralising and coordinating the BGP control plane of a transit network.

## Overview

Overwatch aims to enable flexible inter-domain route selection and performance-aware routing by
logically centralising the BGP control plane. A global and centralised view of the BGP control
plane makes it easier to perform traffic engineering in a network, dynamically adapt to network
changes and utilise network performance metrics in selecting routes and forwarding traffic out
of the network.
